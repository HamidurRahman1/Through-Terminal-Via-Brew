# Through-Terminal-Via-Brew

## What this is repository is about?
This repository is about how to install libraries and applications on OS X through terminal using Homebrew package manager. So why Homebrew? Homebrew is an application that installs libraries or application for you with just a command(s). An application might/usually come with other dependencies which also needs to be downloaded manually by you, well if you Homebrew that won't be necessary anymore. Homebrew will figure out and install the dependencies for you. At some point if do not need an application(s) or library(s) anymore, you can just fire up the terminal and run a single command to uninstall and homebrew will uninstall it and/or delete any files associated with it. [This is the link to Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh/) if one wants to know more about it.


## *To install any libraries or application you must have the right priveligies or the super user of your computer.*
